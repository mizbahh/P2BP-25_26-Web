 * That combination matches wire names to C# property names ignoring CASE ONLY - an
 * underscore is a different character, not a case difference - with [JsonPropertyName]
 * taking precedence where present. Unmatched fields fall back to the C# member default.
 *
 * This matters because the Angular client (services/scan-calibration-service.ts) posts
 *   { output_name, scalar_mm_per_pixel, items: [{ scanId, x_translation, y_translation, Theta }] }
 * which binds on the old server as follows:
 *   scalar_mm_per_pixel -> ScalarMmPerPixel   (explicit [JsonPropertyName]) .... BINDS
 *   items / scanId / Theta -> Items / ScanId / Theta (case-insensitive) ....... BINDS
 *   output_name -> OutputName ................................................. DOES NOT BIND
 *   x_translation / y_translation -> XTranslation / YTranslation .............. DOES NOT BIND
 *
 * So on the old server OutputName silently stays "calibrationScan" and BOTH per-scan
 * translations silently stay 0.0 (default(double)) - the combine step applies rotation
 * only. That is a live bug in the old system, NOT a porting artifact, and it is
 * reproduced here deliberately so the migration does not silently change calibration
 * output. See the migration report; fixing it is a product decision, and the fix is to
 * also accept the snake_case spellings below.
 *
 * Binding faithfully is also what keeps the transform math safe: reading `XTranslation`
 * straight off the raw body would yield `undefined`, and `x += undefined` is NaN, which
 * would write an entire point cloud of NaNs rather than an untranslated one.
